First Game in pygame Officially.
---------------------------------------------
Tic Tac Toe
-----------------

Game can be played forever with play again in case of draw or someone wins. Normal tic tac toe, very rudimentary start to pygame coding.
-----------------------------------------------------
Learned: Screens, mouse button fucntions, drawing, turning code into executables.
------------------------------------
"pip install pyinstaller==5.13.2" in terminal, this version specifically as it allows -w command which makes executable run without commmand prompt loading too
---------------------------------------------
"python -m PyInstaller --onefile -w main.py" to make executable
---------------------------------------------
need to move the executable into the main file in order for it to work with its dependent pathing on assets folder
